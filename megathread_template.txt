This MEGAthread is dedicated to new, inexperienced editors, to beta-testing new concepts and videos, and to anybody who wishes to get better at AMV editing.

## Rules:

* Post your videos in comments. Any top-level comments that are not AMVs for feedback will be deleted.
* You should add a description to your AMV to help other users feedback you properly. For example : *"This is my second AMV, I tried to focus only on the sync and flow. I think it turned out pretty good, but maybe I should use more transitions next time?"*
* **You are free to post all videos that would not be accepted on the main page** (like videos made from footage with watermarks or subtitles). You can post videos shorter than 1 minute, but bear in mind that the purpose of this thread is feedback, not self-presentation. If you want to present your short AMVs, go to Short Edits MEGAthread.
* **You can post only 1 video per MEGAthread** (per month).
* After posting your video, try to go through other comments and **give feedback to some other creator**! They will surely appreciate it.
* Overall behave in the spirit of this thread. If we will see that you are continually posting your videos but not answering to comments, not commenting on others and not being active, you might get banned.

## Additional help:

* We HIGHLY RECOMMEND everyone to read [AMV101 guide from PixelBlended Studios](https://www.amv101.com). It covers the AMV editing workflow really well and easily introduces you to all basic technical stuff like file formats, rendering etc...It's also structured into sections so you can skip some if you are not interested in them (not recommended).
* We have our own [wiki page with links to all different kinds of tutorials and guides.](https://www.reddit.com/r/amv/wiki/guides)
* Join our [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/P5ytbDR)
* Explore links to other AMV communites on the sidebar - they are all experienced and very helpful.
